DOCUMENTATION NOTES

    -------------------------------

    DefaultEncryptionMappingTimeOut is problematic. It's set to 5 seconds in yojimbo_config.h, which means if anybody dynamically sets up a longer timeout, the encryption mapping constant would effectively override it for secure packets. This is bad.

    -------------------------------

    I'm wondering if the gymnastics I've gone through to have complicated ref counted messages is worth it. 

    Specifically, I'm wondering if in a multithreaded environment (eventually, where this library must go...), if the current message structure is harmful rather than helpful. 

    For example, when implementing snapshot systems in the past, I've preferred to take the cost of the copy to enable later parallelism and this has worked out well. 

    Maybe just taking message data and copying it (or even serializing it) into a queue per-client would be faster.

    Don't rework anything just yet, but keep your eyes open and start thinking about multithreading.

    -------------------------------

    The key concern is basically this:

    yojimbo is currently single threaded.

    What does a multithreaded yojimbo look like?

    What has to change?

    -------------------------------

    What about thread safety for queuing messages. Should I redesign the API around atomic queues?

    What about the allocator, does it need to be made multithreaded?

    What about message factory?

    -------------------------------

    It's sort of annoying that there are multiple configuration structs, eg. ClientServerConfig, MessageConfig, ChannelConfig. This is an artifact of the library designed from inside -> out.

    Is it worth exposing the connection concept and the config separately from the server like this, or should it be refactored?

    -------------------------------

    To make this API really final, I need to decide what is public, and what is internal.

    Where is the line? Is the Connection class internal or public?

    -------------------------------

    There is no easy way to broadcast an event to multiple clients from the server.

    Would repeatedly sending the same event to clients work with ref counting? I think it *could8, but right now, I don't think the send message adds a ref, so it won't.

    -------------------------------

    If I were to make a C wrapper for this library, what would I wrap, and what would I leave out?

    This might be a really good way to answer the question about what is public API vs. internal API.

    -------------------------------

    Perhaps separate out the common client/server functionality into BaseServer/BaseClient that implement ServerInterface/ClientInterface.

    This provides users of the library with an implementation path for extending the library to different client/server implementations, which would be necessary to integrate with PS4/X1 APIs.

    -------------------------------

    Maybe:

    FindClientIndex -> FindClientByAddress / FindClientByID

    -------------------------------

    Channel callback to connection, which then calls back to Client/Server is lame.

    Maybe queue up an array of events instead, and provide the caller with a way to process events once per-frame instead?

    I also dislike it, because it could eventually be a callback coming in from a connection running on its own thread = bad.
