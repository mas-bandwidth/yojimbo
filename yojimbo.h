    /** 
        Configuration properties for a message channel.
     
        Channels let you specify different reliability and ordering guarantees for messages sent across a connection.
     
        They may be configured as one of two types: reliable-ordered or unreliable-unordered.
     
        Reliable ordered channels guarantee that messages (see Message) are received reliably and in the same order they were sent. 
        This channel type is designed for control messages and RPCs sent between the client and server.
    
        Unreliable unordered channels are like UDP. There is no guarantee that messages will arrive, and messages may arrive out of order.
        This channel type is designed for data that is time critical and should not be resent if dropped, like snapshots of world state sent rapidly 
        from server to client, or cosmetic events such as effects and sounds.
        
        Both channel types support blocks of data attached to messages (see BlockMessage), but their treatment of blocks is quite different.
        
        Reliable ordered channels are designed for blocks that must be received reliably and in-order with the rest of the messages sent over the channel. 
        Examples of these sort of blocks include the initial state of a level, or server configuration data sent down to a client on connect. These blocks 
        are sent by splitting them into fragments and resending each fragment until the other side has received the entire block. This allows for sending
        blocks of data larger that maximum packet size quickly and reliably even under packet loss.
        
        Unreliable-unordered channels send blocks as-is without splitting them up into fragments. The idea is that transport level packet fragmentation
        should be used on top of the generated packet to split it up into into smaller packets that can be sent across typical Internet MTU (<1500 bytes). 
        Because of this, you need to make sure that the maximum block size for an unreliable-unordered channel fits within the maximum packet size.
        
        Channels are typically configured as part of a ConnectionConfig, which is included inside the ClientServerConfig that is passed into the Client and Server constructors.

    /**
        A reference counted object that can be serialized to a bitstream.

        Messages are objects that are sent between client and server across the connection. They are carried inside the ConnectionPacket generated by the Connection class. Messages can be sent reliable-ordered, or unreliable-unordered, depending on the configuration of the channel they are sent over.
        
        To use messages, create your own set of message classes by inheriting from this class (or from BlockMessage, if you want to attach data blocks to your message), then setup an enum of all your message types and derive a message factory class to create your message instances by type.
        
        There are macros to help make defining your message factory painless:
        
            YOJIMBO_MESSAGE_FACTORY_START
            YOJIMBO_DECLARE_MESSAGE_TYPE
            YOJIMBO_MESSAGE_FACTORY_FINISH
        
        Once you have a message factory, register it with your declared inside your client and server classes using:
        
            YOJIMBO_MESSAGE_FACTORY
        
        which overrides the Client::CreateMessageFactory and Server::CreateMessageFactory methods so the client and server classes use your message factory type.
        
        See tests/shared.h for an example showing you how to do this, and the functional tests inside tests/test.cpp for examples showing how how to send and receive messages.
