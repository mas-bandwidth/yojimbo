libyojimbo v0.1.0
=================

Welcome to the first pre-release of libyojimbo!

Yojimbo is a C++ library for creating secure client/server network protocols.

To build libyojimbo from source you need premake 5.0 from: https://premake.github.io/download.html

If you are running under MacOSX or Linux, go to the command line under libyojimbo directory and type

    premake5 gmake

Which builds makefiles that you can use to build the source via "make all", or via premake with shortcuts:

    premake5 test       // build and run unit tests (loops forever until CTRL-C)

    premake5 info       // build and run network info (prints list of local IP address)

    premake5 cs         // build and run the local client/server testbed with secure connect tokens

    premake5 client     // build and run the client that connects to a yojimbo server I'm running on 173.255.195.190:5000

    premake5 server     // build run your own copy of the server. modify client.cpp to point to your server IP address.

To build on Windows, go to the command line under the libyojimbo directory and type:

    premake5 vs2015

Which creates Yojimbo.sln and a bunch of project files. Double click Yojimbo.sln to open it in Visual Studio.

You can now build and run individual test programs and the library as you would for any other visual studio solution.

This is early release software. Please email any feedback you have to glenn@thenetworkprotocolcompany.com

I hope you find libyojimbo useful!

cheers
